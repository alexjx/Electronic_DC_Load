### DISCLAIMER
### This is an example Makefile and it MUST be configured to suit your needs.
### For detailled explanations about all the avalaible options,
### please refer to https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile/blob/master/arduino-mk-vars.md

### PROJECT_DIR
### This is the path to where you have created/cloned your project
PROJECT_DIR       = $(shell pwd)

### ARDMK_DIR
### Path to the Arduino-Makefile directory.
ARDMK_DIR         ?= $(PROJECT_DIR)/Arduino-Makefile

### ARDUINO_DIR
### Path to the Arduino application and ressources directory.
ARDUINO_DIR       = /opt/arduino

### USER_LIB_PATH
### Path to where the your project's libraries are stored.
USER_LIB_PATH     =  $(PROJECT_DIR)/lib

### Use Library
ARDUINO_LIBS = SPI Wire TimerOne LiquidCrystal_I2C encoder EEPROM

### BOARD_TAG & BOARD_SUB
### For Arduino IDE 1.0.x
### Only BOARD_TAG is needed. It must be set to the board you are currently using. (i.e uno, mega2560, etc.)
# BOARD_TAG         = mega2560
### For Arduino IDE 1.6.x
### Both BOARD_TAG and BOARD_SUB are needed. They must be set to the board you are currently using. (i.e BOARD_TAG = uno, mega, etc. & BOARD_SUB = atmega2560, etc.)
### Note: for the Arduino Uno, only BOARD_TAG is mandatory and BOARD_SUB can be equal to anything
BOARD_TAG         = uno

### MONITOR_BAUDRATE
### It must be set to Serial baudrate value you are using.
MONITOR_BAUDRATE  = 115200

### CFLAGS_STD
CFLAGS_STD        = -std=gnu11

### CXXFLAGS_STD
CXXFLAGS_STD      = -std=gnu++11

### CPPFLAGS
### Flags you might want to set for debugging purpose. Comment to stop.
CXXFLAGS          = -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -Os

### MONITOR_PORT
### The port your board is connected to. Using an '*' tries all the ports and finds the right one. Choose one of the two.
MONITOR_PORT      = /dev/ttyUSB*
# MONITOR_PORT      = /dev/ttyACM*

### don't touch this
CURRENT_DIR       = $(shell basename $(CURDIR))

### OBJDIR
### This is were you put the binaries you just compile using 'make'
CURRENT_DIR       = $(shell basename $(CURDIR))
OBJDIR            = $(PROJECT_DIR)/bin/$(CURRENT_DIR)/$(BOARD_TAG)
